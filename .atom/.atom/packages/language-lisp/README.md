# Lisp language support in Atom

Originally converted from [Texmate lisp bundle](https://github.com/textmate/lisp.tmbundle) as explained in the [atom guide](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle).
Some effort to properly customize this package for Atom might still be needed.

Lisp is a big family of programming languages. This package is primarily intended for the most popular Lisp dialect â€“ the Common Lisp.

For proper Lisp indentation and better editing experience this package should be used in conjunction with some advanced editing tool:
- [Parinfer](https://atom.io/packages/parinfer) (suitable for beginners and gurus alike; automatically manages parentheses based on indentation)
- [Paredit](https://atom.io/packages/lisp-paredit) (recommended for advanced users; manipulates code as abstract syntax tree)
