# C/C++ language support for Atom-IDE

This project is still in its infancy, but the basic idea is to provide support
for C++ and C to Atom-IDE by virtue of the highly experimental LLVM tool,
[Clangd][clangd].

## Development Status
The current implementation should be considered **extremely** experimental,
primarily because [Clangd][clangd] is still under heavy, initial development,
and is therefore missing key functionality, contains bugs, etc.
