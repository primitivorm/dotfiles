Automatic automatic indentation.
Works pretty well for lisp out of the box.
Other modes might need some tweaking to set up:
If you trust the mode's automatic indentation completely, you can add to it's
init hook:

\(set (make-local-variable 'aai-indent-function)
     'aai-indent-defun)

or

\(set (make-local-variable 'aai-indent-function)
     'aai-indent-forward)

depending on whether the language has small and clearly
identifiable functions, that `beginning-of-defun' and
`end-of-defun' can find.

If on the other hand you don't trust the mode at all, but like
the cursor correction and delete-char behaviour,

you can add

\(set (make-local-variable
      'aai-after-change-indentation) nil)

if the mode indents well in all but a few cases, you can change the
`aai-indentable-line-p-function'. This is what I have in my php mode setup:

\(set (make-local-variable
      'aai-indentable-line-p-function)
     (lambda ()
       (not (or (es-line-matches-p \"EOD\")
                (es-line-matches-p \"EOT\")))))

\(fn &optional ARG)" t nil)
